# marching-squares
Marching squares (2D version of marching cubes)

There is a pygame version and an SFML version (C++).

To run the pygame version you need to  
```
pip install opensimplex
```
To compile the C++ version... well, idk, but you will need SFML lol. Good luck

If you don't want to do nothing at all, here is a little gif showing it:
